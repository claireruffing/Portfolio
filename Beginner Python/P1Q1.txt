//Write a “cost of baked goods” calculator. 
//Ask a user to input three pieces of information: the number of hours baking (a float value), 
//the cost for having a baker (cost/hour) (a float value), and the cost of the ingredients (a float value). 
//Output the total cost of the baked goods. The output should be a single floating-point number showing the total cost of baked goods 
//rounded up to one decimal place (use round(var,1) ).

cost_baker = float(input())        # cost for having a baker (cost/hour)
