//Write a script that reads in two integers from the user, then prints all the numbers from 1 to 20, with the following exceptions: 
//If a number is divisible by:

//the first entered integer, print "FIZZ" instead of the number.
//the second entered integer, print "BUZZ" instead of the number.
//both the first AND the second integers, print "FIZZBUZZ" instead of the number.
//For example, if the inputs are 3 and 5, the output should be
//1 2 FIZZ 4 BUZZ FIZZ 7 8 FIZZ BUZZ 11 FIZZ 13 14 FIZZBUZZ 16 17 FIZZ 19 BUZZ

//Note that each item is separated by a single space character and that the expected output has a trailing space followed by a 
//newline character.
