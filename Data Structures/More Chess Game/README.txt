# To create a program using linked lists. The input file consists of a chess board with its chess pieces' positions and then certain piece's moves across the chess board. The output file needs to say whether the chess move was legal or not. If it was an illegal move, it would state the move that was illegal followed by the word illegal. The chess move is illegal if another chess piece is blocking it's path, if the move does not follow the chess piece's move rules, and if there is no source piece on the board.
