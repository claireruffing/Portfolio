#Write a program that takes in two positive integer numbers (N) and (D) and prints out the first N numbers divisible by D. 
#The final output should be a list of N numbers divisible by D. For example, if you count up from 1, and are given N = 3 and D = 4,
# then your output list should be [4, 8, 12].


#create an empty list and iterate thru the list by appending things to the list

def main():

    n = int(input())   #Number of items in the list
    d = int(input())   #Number divisible by
