# To create a recursive program called NQueens.java that uses a file of input with info in arrays with 3 numbers each (the NXN chess board size, the column number of the first queen's position, and the row number of the first queen's position) to print out an array of the new created queens' positions on the chessboard placed where they cannot attack each other.
# 'r1: ' means resources used
